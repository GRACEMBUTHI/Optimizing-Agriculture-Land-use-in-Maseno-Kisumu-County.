<h1> Optimizing Agriculture Land-use in Maseno,Kisumu County. </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project applies Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing to optimize agricultural land use in Maseno, Kisumu County, Kenya. It analyzes land use/land cover changes, soil erosion risks, and crop suitability between 2016 and 2024 using tools like NDVI, NDBI, and RUSLE models. The goal is to identify high-potential zones for agriculture, assess environmental degradation, and inform sustainable land management.
<br />


<h2>Project Objectives </h2>

- <b>To map current land use patterns in the Maseno area.</b> 
- <b>To analyze the suitability of land for growing crops in Maseno using GIS.</b>
- <b>To identify areas prone to environmental degradation that is hindering sustainable agriculture land use practices.</b> 
  

<h2>Tools & Data</h2>

- <b>ArcGIS</b> 
- <b>Landsat 8 imagery</b> 
- <b>SRTM DEM</b> 
- <b>FAO & WorldClim datasets</b> 
- <b>NDVI/NDBI index calculations</b> 
- <b>RUSLE for erosion estimation</b> 
- <b>Field surveys, questionnaires, and key informant interviews</b>

<h2>CONCLUSIONS </h2>
The geospatial analysis and mapping of the Maseno Hospital Area have revealed critical insights into the spatial arrangement, functionality, and condition of the campus infrastructure. The environment is generally well-maintained, with a good balance between developed spaces and green areas. However, certain environmental concerns—such as the proximity of the waste dumpsite to functional buildings—need to be addressed through improved planning and sustainable waste management.
Road infrastructure is fairly well-developed, with a clear hierarchy between main roads and pavements. Nevertheless, the condition and width of some pavements may hinder smooth pedestrian movement, calling for targeted upgrades to improve safety and mobility. The mapped transportation connectivity network provides a strong foundation for traffic flow, though congestion at major junctions remains an area for potential improvement.
Campus facilities—including hostels, lecture halls, clinics, and offices—are strategically located and accessible. However, population pressure on residential and learning spaces may require expansion or refurbishment in the near future. Drainage and power infrastructure are in place, though select areas would benefit from upgrades to enhance resilience and safety.
Overall, the developed geodatabase offers a powerful tool for campus management and planning. By enabling spatial querying, real-time updates, and online accessibility, it promotes data-driven decision-making among students, lecturers, administrators, and planners. The findings from this study set the stage for informed infrastructure development and environmental sustainability within Maseno Campus.
